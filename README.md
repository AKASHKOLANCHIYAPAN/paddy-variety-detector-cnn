# paddy-variety-detector-cnn
it is CNN-powered paddy variety detector using ai/ML,it is hosted as a web app in using Streamlit through the VS Code
. It is  my academic project,i just inspired by a friend's real-time problem he faced while working in a rice mill, so we united together and tried to resolve it.
then,i started collecting a dataset from Chrome. Finally, we found a dataset with 35 varieties of paddies, each contains more than 400 images, which is perfectly suitable for my model training. And we start building a model in Google Colab, then train it with our dataset. After that, i downloaded a model as Keras and loaded it in VS Code for web app building, deployed using Streamlit
